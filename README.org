* Rails 2.3 with Security Patches

We're losers that haven't upgraded from Rails 2.3.14 yet (pity us).
This repository contains a fork of Rails with back-ported security
patches applied.

** Currently Applied Patches:

  - http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q2/504

** Notes

We don't promise that any of this works.  Write your _own_ tests.

** Usage

Add this line to your Gemfile:

#+begin_src ruby
  gem "rails", :git => 'git://github.com/backstop/rails.git', :branch => "2-3-security-patches"
#+end_src
